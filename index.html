          <h1>What is Academus?</h1>
  
          <p>
            Academus is a student's personal assistant; it helps manage classes and assignments,
            facilitate communication with other teachers and students, and more. But this isn't <em>yet
            another system</em>. It integrates with systems students and schools already use, such as
            StudentVUE, Remind, Schoology, and more. Academus will take the data from all of these
            integrations, and forge them into a beautiful planner view filled with data most relevant
            to a student.
          </p>

          <h1>I'm a student. Why should I use Academus?</h1>
  
          <p>
            School life is fragmented. For grades, you might go to StudentVUE, but for test scores
            you might need to go to Illumninate, and for communication you'll need to go to Remind,
            and for resources you need to use... you get it, right? There's too many places to go
            based on what you want.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Academus will integrate all of these systems for you so you only need one place to go for
            everything. Need to check your grade in AP Psych? Use Academus. Need to contact a teacher?
            Use Academus. Want to know when your next club meeting is? Use Academus.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The unique thing about Academus is that it requires absolutely zero action on your school's
            part for it to work; we already have pre-existing integrations with systems like Synergy, so
            all you need to do is log in once with the services your school uses, and we'll take care of
            the rest. 
          </p>

        <section>
          <h1>I'm a school/district administrator. Why should I get Academus for my students?</h1>
  
          <p>
            Academus offers bulk license discounts for districts or schools looking to purchase licenses
            for their students. Some benefits of a district license include:
  
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-integration with all your current systems</li>
              <li>Facilitate clubs and groups for students</li>
              <li>See what your students are up to, and send them announcements</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Academus is a system built for students and the constantly mobile lifestyle they pursue. Students
            will actually want to use Academus since it is mobile-friendly.
