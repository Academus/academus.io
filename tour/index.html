          <p>
            The activity feed shows stuff that you care about &mdash;
            posted assignments, grade changes, and more. It's the first
            thing you see when you open the app and is the easiest way to
            get caught up.

          <p>
            No more manually searching through your grades and assignments
            to see what's changed!

          <h2>Know your GPA at any time.</h2>

          <p>
            Instead of waiting for your report card to come in or calculating
            your GPA manually, Academus will always show your current GPA
            intelligently accounting for course weights.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Put away that calculator! We've got you covered.

          <h2>See how your grade evolves over time.</h2>

          <p>
            Take a look at how your grade has changed over time both visually with a
            graph and in-depth with each grade change shown in a list.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By default, you get up to 2 weeks of grade history, but Academus Scholar
            users are able to see how their grade changed throughout the entire year.

            highest grade? The lowest? How are you doing compared to others?

            A group chat is automatically created for each of your classes with Academus
            Chat. Everyone in that class is automatically added, and anyone can speak!
          </p>

            No more creating Snapchat groups for all of your classes, only to find that someone
