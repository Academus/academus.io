        <h1>Why these guidelines exist</h1>

        <p>
          We wrote these guidelines to help facilitate a safer Academus community
          where everyone feels welcome. You should follow these guidelines when
          participating in Academus Chat.
        </p>

        <h1>Rules you should follow</h1>

        <p>
          When participating in Academus communities (e.g. Chat), please follow these
          guidelines:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU" target="_blank">Be excellent to each other</a></li>
          <li>
            Keep things <em>mostly</em> school appropriate
            <ul>
              <li>
                As teenagers ourselves, we understand that we're not always in line
                with what schools define as "appropriate". For example, stuff like
                mild cussing and non-offensive memes are okay.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Don't use racial slurs or other discriminatory language</li>
          <li>Don't personally attack any other students</li>
          <li>Don't do anything that you might regret in the future</li>
          <li>
            Don't attempt to impersonate Academus staff
            <ul>
              <li>
                It would be silly to, since Academus staff members have a green badge
                next to their name that says "staff". If they don't have this badge,
                then they aren't staff.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you follow these general guidelines, you'll be okay! We hope that these
          guidelines help maintain a safe and welcoming environment in the Academus
          community.
        </p>

        <h1>Reporting inappropriate behavior</h1>

        <p>
          If someone should violate these guidelines, we have systems in place to report
          bad behavior from other users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simply tap a user's message, then "Report". We'll receive your report and look
          into it ASAP. If we find that the user you reported has violated these guidelines,
          we will delete their message, ban them, or both based on the severity of the violation.
