        <h1>Academic Honesty</h1>

        <p>
          When we created Academus Chat, we kept one thing in mind: unfortunately, bad people
          exist in the world. As one student pointed out, it could be devastating for one student
          to not demonstrate academic honesty while using Chat and ruin it for everyone else.
          We do have <a href="/guidelines">community guidelines</a> you need to follow when participating
          in Academus Chat, and we want to make this 100% clear: <strong>We have a zero-tolerance
          policy for academic dishonesty.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why we created several automated and manual moderation tools to help prevent
          this behavior. Our automated moderation system will both filter out offensive words and block
          inappropriate photos from being posted, as well as bring suspicious content to our attention
          for human review. But automated systems can't catch everything&mdash;that's where you come in.
          We know you have heard this phrase repeated over and over again, but <strong>if you see something,
          say something.</strong> Since we do not actively monitor all Academus chats, we rely on user
          reports to catch bad actors. Some examples of academic dishonesty include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Posting answers to a future test</li>
          <li>Posting a photo of an entire completed homework assignment</li>
          <li>Any other form of attempted cheating</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you see any of these things (in addition to any of the things
          found in our community guidelines), you should report the message:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Tap and hold the message, and tap "Report".</li>
          <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Tap the message and tap "Report Message".</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your report will be kept anonymous. We will investigate every message that is flagged for review
          and if we discover that it violates our guidelines or demonstrates academic dishonesty, we may
          take the following action on the offender:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Deleting the offending message</li>
          <li>Banning the offender from the chat they posted the message in</li>
          <li>Banning the offender from Academus Chat as a whole</li>
          <li><strong>In extreme cases of academic dishonesty, we may contact school administration.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We really hope that it doesn't come to that last bullet point (or even the first three), but we will
          not hesitate to take action if necesssary.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, of course, there's nothing to be worried about if you simply practice academic honesty as you would
          all throughout your school. We know the majority of people reading this won't be affected by the punishments
          described above, but we felt the need to be explicit with our stance on academic dishonesty. We hope everyone
          has fun in Academus Chat and finds it useful!
