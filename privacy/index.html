        <h1>What data does Academus collect?</h1>

        <p>
          When you sign up for an account, Academus will collect information including,
          but not limited to:

          <ul>
            <li>Your first and last name</li>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>A password for your account, which is later hashed and salted in our database</li>
          </ul>

          When you add an integration to your Academus account, the specific information varies.
          For StudentVUE integrations, Academus will collect:

          <ul>
            <li>Your StudentVUE username</li>
            <li>Your StudentVUE password, which is later tokenized and salted in our database</li>
          </ul>

          For PowerSchool integrations, Academus will collect:

          <ul>
            <li>Your district code</li>
            <li>Your PowerSchool username</li>
            <li>Your PowerSchool password, which is later tokenized and salted in our database</li>
          </ul>

          Other data that is collected can include, but is not limited to:

          <ul>
            <li>Your legal name (provided by SIS integrations)</li>
            <li>Your physical address</li>
            <li>Your phone number</li>
            <li>Other personal information provided by integrations</li>
          </ul>

          We <strong>never</strong> store any unnecessary info like your physical address in our database, but we'd like
          to be transparent about every bit of data that goes through our infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h1>How does Academus protect data?</h1>

        <p>
          We know that student information systems can hold sensitive information about a user,
          and this is why we've taken several steps to ensure that your data is safe and secure.
          We use industry-standard SSL encryption in all communications between the app and server,
          and tokenize third-party usernames and passwords whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our infrastructure is hosted on Azure, with each server having isolated Dockerized containers
          that only expose the resources necessary (such as the API server) for the app to work.
          Every server we own is protected by a private key and has the latest security updates.
