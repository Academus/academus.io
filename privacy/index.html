        <p>
          By continuing to use Academus, you accept this privacy policy. If you do not agree
          with this privacy policy, you may contact us and we will delete your account and
          scrub all data related to you from our servers.

        <h1>What data does Academus collect?</h1>

        <h2>For Students</h2>

        <p>
          When you sign up for an account, Academus Technologies, LLC ("we", "us", or "Academus")
          will collect information including, but not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Your first and last name</li>
          <li>Your email address</li>
          <li>A password for your account, which is later hashed and salted in our database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When you add an integration to your Academus account, the specific information varies.
          For StudentVUE integrations, Academus will collect:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Your StudentVUE username</li>
          <li>Your StudentVUE password, which is later tokenized and salted in our database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For PowerSchool integrations, Academus will collect:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Your district code</li>
          <li>Your PowerSchool username</li>
          <li>Your PowerSchool password, which is later tokenized and salted in our database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Prior to May 22, 2018, sensitive information such as physical address,
          phone number, etc. may have been passed through our system, but was
          <strong>immediately discarded</strong>. Nobody saw this information,
          but we feel it is right to be transparent about every piece of data
          that passes &mdash; or has passed &mdash; through our infrastructure.
          Since then, we have worked closely with integration providers to
          obtain different methods of linking accounts that doesn't involve
          any sensitive info, so that it never even reaches our servers.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you participate in Academus Chat, messages you send will be stored
          on our infrastructure (this includes text messages and photos). We will
          <strong>not</strong> access messages you send in class group chats unless
          another Academus user reports it as potentially inappropriate. In this case,
          we will take a look at the reported message, and if necessary, messages
          surrounding yours, to determine if the message is inappropriate or not.
          If we do determine that your message violates our community guidelines,
          we will take appropriate action as described in our Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you upload photos to Academus Chat, they will be sent to Google's
          servers for processing. They will be promptly discarded once they have
          been processed.
        </p>

        <h2>For Educators</h2>

        <p>
          When you sign up for an Academus for Teachers account,
          Academus Technologies, LLC ("we", "us", or "Academus")
          will collect information including, but not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Your first and last name</li>
          <li>Your school-issued email address</li>
          <li>A password for your account, which is later hashed and salted in our database</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We may use your email address to send transactional emails, such as
          those used to verify your identity as a teacher. We will never
          send you unsolicited marketing emails unless you specifically
          opt-in to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to purchase Academus Scholar, we will transmit
          your name and payment information to our payment partner
          Stripe, whose privacy policy you can read
          <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.
          We are never able to see your payment information. You can read
          more about how Stripe secures your payment information on
          their

        <h1>How does Academus use your data?</h1>

        <p>
          Our bottom line is this: <strong>your data is yours, you have control over it,
          and only you will ever see it</strong>. Due to the sensitivity of data
          we are storing, your data will <em>never be for sale, no matter what the
          price</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will never share any personally-identifiable information about you
          publicly. However, we may use <strong>anonymized</strong> data to bring
          useful statistics to other students such as, but not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Average grade for a course</li>
          <li>How many students take a course</li>
          <li>Your performance compared to other students</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You can, of course, opt out of data analytics through the Privacy and
          Security section in Settings. If you do, however, you will not be able
          to view these statistics from within the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          We take extra care to ensure that grade data is never able to be traced back
          to a single person. All data is anonymized and aggregated before being displayed
          anywhere.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>How does Academus protect data?</h1>

        <p>
          We know that student information systems can hold sensitive information about a user,
          and this is why we've taken several steps to ensure that your data is safe and secure.
          We use industry-standard SSL encryption in all communications between the app and server,
          and tokenize third-party usernames and passwords whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services, with each server having isolated Dockerized containers
          that only expose the resources necessary (such as the API server) for the app to work.
          Every server we own is protected by a private key and has the latest security updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, we have additional safeguards in place to ensure that any Academus admin is not
          able to access any of your sensitive info &mdash; only what is needed to troubleshoot issues.
          We also protect user passwords with an industry standard hashing algorithm called bcrypt.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>AdMob</h1>

        <p>
          We use AdMob to provide unobtrusive ads in the Academus iOS and Android apps. These ads are
          <strong>not</strong> targeted &mdash; this is to comply with state laws and also ensure our
          users' privacy. Your Academus data will never be passed to AdMob for processing or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since Academus is an education-oriented app, we have additionally blocked potentially
          inappropriate or sensitive advertisement categories from appearing inside of the app:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Nightclubs, Bars &amp; Music Clubs</li>
          <li>Black Magic, Astrology &amp; Esoteric</li>
          <li>Cosmetic Procedures &amp; Body Modification</li>
          <li>Dating</li>
          <li>Drugs &amp; Supplements</li>
          <li>Get Rich Quick</li>
          <li>Politics</li>
          <li>References to Sex &amp; Sexuality</li>
          <li>Religion</li>
          <li>Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health</li>
          <li>Social Casino Games</li>
          <li>Alcohol</li>
          <li>Gambling &amp; Betting</li>
        </ul>
