    <h1>v0.5.0: The big update.</h1>

    <p>
      We've been working hard over the past month to bring you three new things we think
      you'll like. Two of these we previously announced (Academus Chat and Academus Scholar),
      and one more we're announcing &mdash; our first contest. Scroll down to learn more.
    </p>

    <h1>Academus Chat</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Imagine this scenario:</strong> You get home and start doing your homework,
      but then you suddenly realize &mdash; you forgot to write the assignment down!
      You don't have contact info for anyone in that class, it's too late
      to contact your teacher, and the assignment is due at midnight. You're
      doomed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students have come up with solutions to this problem, like creating
      group chats on Snapchat for everyone in that class. This raises new
      problems, however: Who can invite you? Who owns it? What if you don't
      know about it? What if there are several groups for your class?
    </p>

    <p>
      In response, we're releasing our <strong>largest, most useful feature yet: Academus Chat</strong>.
      Academus Chat will automatically create a group chat for each of your
      classes where you can talk with your classmates, help each other
      out with assignments, and more. Stuck on a homework problem? Send a photo
      of your work in Academus Chat and get immediate help from your peers.
      Wondering when the next chapter test is? Ask your classmates on Academus
      Chat.
    </p>

    <p>
      We worked very hard on Academus Chat to make it the best it can possibly
      be, and we hope you'll find it useful. We put it through rigorous testing
      while it was in development, but there will always be bugs in software. If
      you spot one, drop us a line. You can find us in Settings > Chat with us.
      (Eventually we will move this system to Academus Chat itself!)
    </p>

    <h1>Academus Scholar</h1>
    
    <p>
      Academus is awesome as it is. But we think it can be better. We're building out new
      features and rolling them out through Academus Scholar &mdash; our new subscription
      plan. With Scholar, you can get new features early, get premium versions of existing
      features (like Grade History), and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be clear, <strong>Academus will remain free.</strong> Academus Scholar is simply
      an add-on subscription for those looking to get more out of Academus, and for those
      who wish to support us. The Academus Scholar benefits that we are announcing today
      include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Extended Grade History (up to 1 year)</li>
      <li>Hide advertisements in the app</li>
      <li>Early access to new features we are developing</li>
      <li>Support the Academus team :)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We will be actively developing new features for our Scholar users, so be on the
      lookout for those.
    </p>
