    <h1>Welcome to the 2018-2019 school year!</h1>

    <p>
      We know coming back might be hard for some of you, while
      others couldn't be happier for the start of a new school year.
      No matter who you are, we have a plethora of new features we will
      be rolling out this semester that we think you'll enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2>Academus Chat</h2>

    <p>
      Possibly one of our biggest features, Academus Chat lets you talk to
      your classmates without ever having to set up a group chat manually.
      Group chats for each of your classes are automatically made and students
      join automatically when they join Academus.
    </p>

    <h2>Academus Scholar</h2>

    <p>
      Over the summer we realized something: we have no money! Our hosting isn't
      free, so we had to figure out a way to break even. We came up with Academus
      Scholar: a premium version of Academus for those wanting to get the most
      out of the app. <strong>Academus will still be free</strong>, this is simply
      an upgrade. With Academus Scholar, you will unlock features such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced grade history data</li>
      <li>Go ad-free</li>
      <li>something something</li>
      <li>god I hope I remember to change this before the app is published</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you were part of our 138 alpha testers last school year, you already have
      Academus Scholar free. For life. <em>(The alpha stage ended on April 24, so
      if you signed up on or before then, you have Scholar.)</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Grade History</h2>

    <p>
      Those of you on Android have already seen this feature, but now it's coming to
      iOS! With Grade History, you can see how your grade changed over time with a handy
      chart.
