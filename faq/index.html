        <h2 id="what-is-academus">What's Academus?</h2>

        <p>
          Academus is the best way to keep track of your school life as a high school student.
          You can basically replace StudentVUE, PowerSchool, or whatever else your school uses
          to give you information about your grades. We have a bunch of cool features that you
          also couldn't get with those apps either, like class averages and stuff. Go check it
          out. It's available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.academus.android">Android</a>
          and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1366365507?pt=119029701&ct=academus-try&mt=8">iOS</a>.

        <h2 id="who-made-academus">Who made Academus? Why should I trust you?</h2>
        
        <p>
          Academus was made by a group of 5 high school students since we were fed up with StudentVUE,
          the system that our school uses for SIS. You can trust us because we have a solid <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
          and legitimately don't care about what your grades are &mdash; they are safe with us.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although, if you choose not to trust us, that's fine as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        <h2 id="adding-integrations">How do I add an integration?</h2>

        <p>
          To add an integration, go to Settings (or Manage on iOS) > Manage Integrations.
          From there, tap the plus button to add one (it's in the top-right on iOS, and
          in the bottom-right on Android). Follow the steps from there to add your
          integration of choice.
        </p>

        <h2 id="no-integrations">Why don't I see anything in my course list?</h2>

        <p>
          It could be one of two things:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>You don't have any integrations set up.</strong> If you don't have any integrations added,
            we have nothing to get your grades from! Follow the steps <a href="#adding-integrations">here</a>
            to add an integration
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If you just added an integration, it's still syncing.</strong> It might take a minute to sync
            an integration if you just added it. If nothing shows up after a few minutes, please
            contact us in-app in Settings (or Manage on iOS) > Chat with us.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="out-of-date">The grades in Academus aren't up-to-date. Why?</h2>

        <p>
          Integrations sync once every hour. It's possible that if the grade was added/changed
          less than an hour ago, it hasn't synced yet. If you want to force-sync your integration,
          you can go to Settings (or Manage on iOS) > Manage Integrations, then tap your integration
          to sync it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note, though, that integrations are queued to be synced. We sync around 20 integrations at
          a time so our servers don't explode, so syncing an integration manually will add it to the
          end of the queue.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="chat-notifications">How do I get notified for an Academus Chat group?</h2>
        
        <p>
          If you want to get notified for messages in an Academus Chat group, tap on the group's
          profile picture, then toggle the "Notifications" switch under the group info. If it's on,
          you will receive notifications for every message in that chat. (Mentions and replies are
          coming soon&mdash;with those, you will only be notified for messages which you are mentioned
          in.)
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="bug-reporting">I FOUND A BUG! Where do I report it?</h2>

        <p>
          If you found a bug, please let us know in Settings (or Manage on iOS) > Chat with us.
          We'll get back to you and fix it ASAP.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="not-answered-here">My question was not answered here.</h2>

        <p>
          That's not a question. But if you want to ask us one, you can do so
          <a href="/help" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> or in-app
          via Settings (or Manage on iOS) > Chat with us. We'll try to get
          back to you quickly.
