        <h1>Our Vision</h1>

        <p>
          As students, we think education technology sucks. It's fragmented, uses super
          old legacy technology, and seems like it's stuck in 2005. We decided that we'd
          like to solve these problems:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fragmentation</strong> &mdash; Students are told to go to 2 or 3 different services to get
              information about different stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unreliability</strong> &mdash; Oftentimes, the services that students use to e.g. view their
              grades are down, they crash, or other issues that make them unreliable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sub-par Design</strong> &mdash; Lots of services have
              <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FreeLance.StudentVUE" target="_blank">very poor design</a>
              that's not very pleasing to the eye.
            </li>
          </ul>

          We proposed a solution: <strong>unify everything into one place</strong>. So
          we made Academus. While developing the app, we kept these goals in mind:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ease of Use</strong> &mdash; Keep the UI simple. Show relevant information front and center.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Elegant Design</strong> &mdash; We want students to enjoy using our app, so we need to make
              it "wow" them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Uniqueness</strong> &mdash; We want to stand out from the crowd. We're not simply another app
              that lets you check your grades; we're more than that.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
