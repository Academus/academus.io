        <h1>The Survey</h1>

        <p>
          As you might know, we recently conducted a user satisfaction survey! We'd like
          to share some of the results with you, as well as respond to your feedback.
          Let's go over some feedback from our users:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Academus keeps logging me out for some reason</em>
          <br><strong>- A student</strong>
        </blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
          <em>Keep me logged in </em>
          <br><strong>- A student</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Make it so it doesn’t log me out every time I close the app</em>
          <br><strong>- A student</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <em>the app keeps logging me out</em>
          <br><strong>- Sara R.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <em>It’s really annoying when it logs you out.</em>
          <br><strong>- Lane W.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          We hear you. This is a bug on the iOS side of things and is definitely not intentional.
          We believe the issue lies within a piece of software we use for authentication, so we're
          going to try and sort that out over the next few months. Thank you for your patience! And
          know that we feel your pain (we have to deal with the issue, too).
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>I feel more themes should be involved with the app to make experience with it more enjoyable and pleasant</em>
          <br><strong>- A student</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          A light theme is something we have planned for quite a while. While it will likely be
          pretty easy on the Android version of the app, the way we built the iOS app won't let us
          add themes easily. So while we do our big rewrite of the apps over the semester, we will
          make sure to make themes easier to add (for us).
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>
            Give the student the option to create “mock assignments” in which they can add an assignment in a category and give themselves a score to see how it would impact their grade. This would be useful for students who want to know exactly how well they have to do on a specific assignment or test other than finals before it actually gets put into the grade book.
          </em>
          <br><strong>- Alan P.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Thanks for the suggestion, Alan! We have thought of something like this in the past, but
          we haven't found an elegant way to put it in the app &mdash; we may add this in a future
          version of the app.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Display points possible on upcoming assignments/due dates</em>
          <br><strong>- Cameron C.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, many student information systems do not give us the necessary information to display
          points possible in Academus, so it is unlikely that we'll see this feature any time soon.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Remove adds</em> (sic)
          <br><strong>- A student</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Sadly, hosting Academus is not free so we opted to use ads to cover some of the cost.
          You can remove ads by purchasing Academus Scholar in Settings (or Manage on iOS) :)
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>You should make it so that we can customize the name of our classes.</em>
          <br><strong>- Terrell L.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Actually, this feature is already a thing! Technically, at least... The ground work is already
          laid out in our back-end code, but we just haven't gotten around to adding it in the app. We'll likely
          see this in the next version or two.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Sometimes it takes bit longer for grades to update on Academus than it does with Student VUE [&hellip;]</em>
          <br><strong>- Jessica S.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Good observation, Jessica. This is because Academus syncs with your integrations (StudentVUE, PowerSchool, etc.)
          every hour. You can, however, manually sync your integrations at any time by going to Settings > Manage Integrations
          then tap on your integration. Wait a few minutes for everything to process, and it should be up-to-date.
          We are considering faster auto-syncing times for our Scholar subscribers.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>there is something wrong with the UI of my grade book screen and my grade text overlaps the name of the class [&hellip;]</em>
          <br><strong>- Jolin Z.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is a simple bug fix, and should be fixed in the next version of the app.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <em>Show me actual class assignments and tell me what is missing and what’s not.</em>
          <br><strong>- Brendan N.</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You can find all your class assignments by tapping on the class. The ability to see
          what's missing at a glance is very useful; thanks for the suggestion, Brendan!
        </p>
